Navigating Datasets
===================

To move forward or backwards through the dataset, press '.' (forward) or ',' (backward) - these are on the '<' and '>' keys on a UK keyboard. You can also drag the horizontal slider at the base of the window (see Fig. 2) to move through the image set, or type the number image you want to skip to into the spin box on the bottom right.
