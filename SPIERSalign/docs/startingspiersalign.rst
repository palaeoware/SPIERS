Starting SPIERSalign
====================

Start the program, and select *Open* from the File menu. Navigate to the folder containing your dataset and press ok. Alternatively you can choose a recently opened dataset from the list shown in Open Recent on the File menu. If this is a new dataset SPIERSalign will ask if you want to check that image dimensions are the same; this is recommended for all but expert users. After performing this check, the program will then display the first image of the sequence.
