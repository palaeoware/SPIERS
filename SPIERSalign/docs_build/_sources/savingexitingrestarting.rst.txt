Saving, Exiting, and Restarting a SPIERSalign Session
=====================================================

To exit an (unfinished) SPIERSalign session simply close the program window; this saves all settings and exits. The settings file can also be saved at any point by choosing Save on the File menu (*Ctrl-S*). It is recommended the settings are saved every few images. To start again at a later date, open (as above) the same working directory. While working with a dataset, a backup settings file can be saved at any point with the Save Backup command on the File menu (*Ctrl-Shift-S*). This will create a time-stamped settings file of the form “settings backup - 16 Sep 2008 - 15.42.50.txt”. Such a backup can be loaded at any time and applied to the dataset (see *Loading A Settings File* below).
