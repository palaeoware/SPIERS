Using SPIERSalign With CT Data 
==============================

Data from CT scanners is pre-aligned, but use of SPIERSalign to prepare CT data is nonetheless encouraged, as it allows you to crop the dataset easily for SPIERSedit, creating smaller working images and hence faster image processing. With CT or other pre-aligned data, steps 1-5 in previous section can be omitted.
