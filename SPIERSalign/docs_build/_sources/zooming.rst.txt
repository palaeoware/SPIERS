Zooming the Image
=================

*Ctrl* = allows you to zoom in, and *Ctrl -* is zoom out. *Ctrl-R* displays the working image at 100% (one pixel in image = one pixel onscreen), and *Ctrl-Shift-R* fits it to the window (normally the correct thing to do). These zoom commands are also all available from the *Zoom* menu. They do not rescale the underlying image, merely change the magnification with which it is displayed onscreen.
