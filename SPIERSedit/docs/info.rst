Info
====

The *Info* panel (see Fig. 20, bottom) shows information such as the
position of the brush, which mask and segment it is currently over, and
data regarding the resolution of source and working images, together
with XY dataset downsampling ratio. It also provides a notes box, which
is very useful for recording different generation settings for parts of
the data, things to do, and anything else worth remembering regarding
the dataset.
