Exporting Working Images
========================

In some situations it can be useful to export SPIERSedit’s working
images, as displayed on-screen. For instance, this can be used to
document the interpretation stage of a virtual specimen for publication.
The *Export Working Image Set…* command on the *Output* menu provides
this facility. Selecting it prompts the user for a directory, and a
series of images, one for each slice, are then computed and placed
within this directory. Note that no progress bar is provided, but the
progress of this export can be followed with the position slider at the
base of the main window. This command outputs whatever is visible in the
main working image; this should be set up as desired (e.g. with/without
source image overlay) prior to the export. Files are exported in .png
format.
