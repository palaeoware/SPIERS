Introduction
============

SPIERSedit is a package for editing (i.e. preparing) tomographic
(slice-based) datasets from any source, for example serial grinding,
serial sectioning, or computed tomography, and exporting them as
three-dimensional models. It is the core part of the SPIERS package,
which includes two other separately documented programs, SPIERSalign
(used to prepare data for SPIERSedit) and SPIERSview (used to view and
manipulate the 3D models SPIERSedit produces).
