Manipulating objects independently
==================================

While normal use of SPIERSview is to keep objects in the same position
relative to each other, there is sometimes a need to shift, rotate and
scale certain objects independently. This facility, turned on or off
using the *Reposition Selected* command under the *Mode* menu, is
especially useful in conjunction with multi-piece datasets (see below).

With this mode selected, all rotates and shifts made using the mouse or
menu commands affect only the objects currently selected in the object
panel, as do any scale changes (see below).

*Reposition Selected* mode is not available when SPIERSview is running
in *Finalised/VAXML* mode.
