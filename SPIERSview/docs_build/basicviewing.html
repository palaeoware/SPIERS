<p>The default SPIERSview screen setup has the main view window (black) on
the right, the ‘objects panel’ on the left, and progress panel at the
bottom (see Fig. 1). The Main view window and the Zoom slider (see
below) are permanently visible – the panels can be hidden, resized,
repositioned or set to ‘float’ as the user desires. In addition to the
two initially visible panels there are three more, the Clipping panel,
Info panel and Pieces panel (discussed later). Panels are switched on
and off using the view menu, or the keyboard shortcuts indicated in
their title bars (F1, F2, F3, F4 and F6).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<img alt="_images/figure_1.png" src="_images/figure_1.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 1. Default anatomy of a SPIERSview window</span></p>
</div>
<p>The status bar at the bottom gives total model size in KTr (1 Ktr = 1000
triangles). If objects are selected in the objects panel, the size given
is for the selected objects only. A volume for selected objects is also
given in cubic millimetres; this is calculated from raw data exported
from SPIERSedit, and does not take into account any reduction from
island removal, smoothing, fidelity reduction etc. Note that volume
calculations are not currently corrected for any inconsistent
slice-spacings specified in SPIERSedit.</p>
<p>When viewing models in SPIERSview finalised format (.spvf) or VAXML
format (.vaxml), the interface is simplified; many menu options will not
appear, and the pieces panel is not available. Volume measurements (see
above) are also not available.</p>
<div class="section" id="moving-rotating-and-zooming">
<h2>4.1. Moving, rotating and zooming<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-rotating-and-zooming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The model can be moved by dragging using the left mouse button, and
rotated in three dimensions by dragging with the right mouse button. You
can also rotate around the z-axis (the viewing direction) using the left
and right arrow keys (hold shift down to make rotate faster), or by
holding the shift-key down while dragging with the right mouse button.
It is also possible to ‘lock’ the viewer into rotate mode by ticking the
<em>rotate lock</em> command (Ctrl-R) on the Mode menu (this is primarily
useful on single-button OSX systems). Also see “Touch screens” below.</p>
<p>The <em>Simple Autospin</em> command (Ctrl-U) on the Animation menu sets the
model spinning around the y-axis (up/down on the screen) until the
command is selected a second time. More advanced spins and animation
exports are covered in the Animation System section (below).</p>
<p>The <em>Zoom slider</em> (see Fig. 1) is used to zoom the view; the Page Up and
Page Down keys also perform the same function, as does the mouse-wheel
(if present). Also see “Touch screens” below.</p>
<p>The <em>Move closer</em> and <em>Move further</em> commands ([ and ] keys) on the View
menu are used to move the camera closer to or away from the model; this
has a similar effect to zooming, but may be preferable if, for instance,
the model is so close to the camera that perspective distortions are
unacceptable. Hold shift down ({ and } keys) for larger moves closer or
away. Note that in Orthographic mode there will be no visible effect of
moving the model backwards or forwards in this way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="touch-screen-support">
<h2>4.2. Touch screen support<a class="headerlink" href="#touch-screen-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Modern computers with touch screens should be compatible with SPIERSview for basic object moving,
roatating, and zooming. The model can be moved by one finger dragging, and
rotated around around the z-axis (the viewing direction) using two finger rotation.
Rotated in three dimensions can be achieved by toggling the <em>rotate lock</em> command (Ctrl-R),
or by holding down Crlt while one finger dragging. Zooming in/out can be achieved
by using the two finger pinch-to-zoom gesture.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="object-visibility">
<h2>4.3. Object visibility<a class="headerlink" href="#object-visibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SPIERSview models consist of a number of <em>objects</em> and <em>groups</em> of
objects (see below) which are listed in the <em>Object panel</em> on the left
of the screen (Fig. 1). Each object is normally given a different
colour, and each object or group can be independently turned on or off
(hidden from view), enabling the user to perform ‘virtual dissections’.
This can be done by double-clicking the ‘eye’ icon for each object in
the object panel (see Figure 1), or by using the keyboard key assigned
to the object (the single character A-Z or 0-9 visible to the right of
the eye icon). Objects are not required to have a key assigned, in which
case they can only have their visibility toggled with the ‘eye’ icon. If
a group is hidden then all objects or groups within it, irrespective of
their visibility setting, are not visible.</p>
<p>The objects menu has <em>Show All</em> (Shift+H) and <em>Hide All</em> (Ctrl+H) commands which can be
used to set the visibility of all objects either on or off. An <em>Invert
Show</em> (Crtl+I) command also exists, which hides all currently shown objects, and
vice versa.</p>
<p>Note that transparency (see section on transparency later on) can be used as an alternative to
simply hiding objects in some situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stereoscopic-3d-viewing">
<h2>4.4. Stereoscopic 3D viewing<a class="headerlink" href="#stereoscopic-3d-viewing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SPIERSview can run in several 3D display modes (top five options in the
Mode menu). These are:</p>
<p><em>Orthographic (Ctrl-O)</em>: Orthographic rendering without perspective effects
(distant objects will not appear any smaller than close ones). This is
mode is useful for measuring specimens, in conjunction with the scale
grid.</p>
<p><em>Perspective (Ctrl-P)</em>: Normal display without any form of stereoscopic 3D, but
with perspective rendering (distant objects will appear smaller). This
is the default.</p>
<p><em>Anaglyph Stereo (Ctrl-A)</em>: Anaglyph stereo mode splits the left and
right eye images using red (left) and cyan (right) filters, and allows
3D viewing using red/cyan or red/green glasses; the former will work
better, but the latter are normally adequate. This is intended as a
cheap and effective means of viewing 3D images, but (unlike <em>Split
Stereo</em> or <em>QuadBuffer Stereo</em> modes) does not fully preserve colour
information. Anaglyph stereo viewing may also be hampered if the model
contains strong colours; the <em>Mute Colours</em> command (Ctrl-M) on the Mode
menu can help in these cases, as it reduces colour saturation.</p>
<p><em>Split Stereo (Ctrl-S)</em>: This mode splits the Main view window in two,
displaying the left and right eye images in the left and right halves.
Direct viewing in this mode requires viewer to be able to separately
focus on each image. Screen captures (see below) in this mode can be
used to generate printed stereo-pairs for viewing with a magnifying
stereoscope.</p>
<p><em>QuadBuffer Stereo (Ctrl-Q)</em>: This mode sends the left and right eye images
separately to the OpenGL rendering system where they can be interpreted
by dedicated 3D display hardware. Most 3D display systems can handle
OpenGl QuadBuffer input, and hence SPIERSview should be able to use this
mode to produce stereoscopic 3D output using most 3D screens and
projectors. Please note that no guarantee of success for any particular
hardware can be provided.</p>
<p>The user may find that the default ‘medium’ stereo-separation (the
strength of the stereoscopic effect) is too high or too low in some
situations. Stereo-separation can be set to one of five preset
strengths, accessed through the View menu or using the keyboard
shortcuts Alt+1 (very low) through Alt+5 (very high).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="full-screen-mode">
<h2>4.5. Full Screen Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#full-screen-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SPIERSview can run in a full screen (Crtl+F) mode where the 3D view is maximised to
the maxiumum monitor height and width. Under Windows a frameless and undecorated
window is produced. While under Linux a minimal framed and decorated window is used.
When in full screen mode use (Crtl+F) to toggle back to normal mode.</p>
<p>Note that under full screen mode only the 3D view is displayed, all other pannels and menus
are not shown. However, all shortcut key combinations will still work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="background-colour">
<h2>4.6. Background Colour<a class="headerlink" href="#background-colour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By default SPIERSview uses a black background for specimens, but this
can be changed at will using the <em>Background Colour…</em> command on the
<em>View</em> menu. Changes to the background colour are saved in SPV files,
but not in VAXML or SPVF files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bounding-box-mode">
<h2>4.7. Bounding Box Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#bounding-box-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Selecting the <em>Bounding Box Mode</em> command on the Mode menu causes all
items to render as wireframe boxes. Bounding box rendering is far faster
than normal rendering, and may, for instance, assist with the initial
placement of objects when assembling multi-piece models.</p>
