Update system
=============

SPIERSview incorporates an auto-updating system (as do the other two
SPIERS applications). If connected to the internet, it will check for
updates every time it is run. If it finds an update it will give you the
option of downloading and installing it. Agreeing to this will close
SPIERSview once the updater has been downloaded.
