Update System
=============

SPIERSedit incorporates an auto-updating system (as do the other two
SPIERS applications). If connected to the Internet, it will check for
updates every time it is run. If it finds an update it will give the
user the option of downloading and installing it. Agreeing to this will
close SPIERSedit once the updater has been downloaded, and the proceed
to install the update.
