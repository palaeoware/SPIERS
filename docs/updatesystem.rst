Update System
=============

SPIERSalign incorporates an auto-updating system (as do the other two SPIERS applications). If connected to the Internet, it will check for updates every time it is run. If it finds an update it will give you the option of downloading and installing it. Agreeing to this will close SPIERSalign once the updater has been downloaded.
